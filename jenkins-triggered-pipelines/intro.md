In this scenario you'll learn how to configure Jenkins to use Groovy-based [Pipelines](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Pipeline+Plugin) for building software from Github. 

The scenario is designed to demostrate how you can use Groovy Pipelines within a CI/CD pipeline to download software code from [GitHub](https://github.com/), perform unit tests and display a historical test result report.

We are using a Docker host environment and we will show, how to run Jenkins in a Docker container. The steps guide you to installing the required plugins, creating a build and viewing the test report results.
