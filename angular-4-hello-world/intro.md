In this scenario you'll learn how to get started with Angular 4. 

We will 
- clone a Angular 4 template,
- install all necessary packages into a fresh Ubuntu Docker container 
- create an index file 
- define a single page Hello World app.
- view the app in a Browser

The commands are run in a Docker host environment, so you do not need to install anything locally. Instead, you can run all commands in a console within an Internet browser.
