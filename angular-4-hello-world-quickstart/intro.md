In this scenario you'll learn how to get started with Angular 4 (the tutorial works also with Angular 2). 

We will 
- install all necessary packages into a fresh CentOS Docker container 
- clone a Angular 4 template from GIT,
- define a single page Hello World app,
- view the app in a Browser
- demonstrate the binding between model and view

The commands are run in a Docker host environment, so you do not need to install anything locally. Instead, you can run all commands in a console within an Internet browser.
